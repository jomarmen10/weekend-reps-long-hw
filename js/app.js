/*
How do we assign a value to a variable?
we can assign using let var and const

How do we change the value of a variable?
we can use =

How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
you can assign it by declaring a new variable and using = to assign the new variable to an existing variable

Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
declaring variable is creating a new variable
assigning it is giving a value to the variable
difine is giving the variable multiple value

What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
to write code in plain english so that you can construct the process more easily

What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
75% - 90% of thingking and 25%-75% of coding; */
